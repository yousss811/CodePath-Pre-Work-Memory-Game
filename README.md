## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
This challenge was rather simple in my opinion. I would say that the most difficult part was getting used to the new languages as I do not have too much experience with the languages used during this project,
however, I feel that I picked it up quite quickly and was able to complete the project with ease given previous background in website development with WordPress. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am curious to learn about hosting solutions that are used in the industry. While in this project, we used Glitch to both build and host our website, I would like to learn about server hosting using ones own 
hardware rather than solutions such as Amazon AWS or other similar solutions. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on the project, I would first complete the rest of the optional features, such as the time limit. Since this project is being used as a learning project, what I like to do is read arbritary
articles that have general relavence to the project I'm working on and use that as inpiration to add extra features to my project. For example, I was reaing an article on using Databases with web apps. Something that
would be very interesting to add to this project would be a database that would store the highscore
